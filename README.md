# Heart-desiase-prediction-model
Heart desiase prediction model using ML models.
The dataset used for traing the model is UCI dataset.
Mainly we are classifying the targeted attribute as 0 or 1 .
Hence the model used are all binary classification model.
Machine Learning algorithms used:

1. Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
2. Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
3. Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
4. K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
5. Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
6. Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
7. XGBoost (Scikit-learn)
8. Artificial Neural Network with 1 Hidden layer (Keras)

Accuracy achieved: 95% (Random Forest)
